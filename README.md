# Exploring Mars: Scraping and Analyzing News and Weather Data
This repository showcases a project that leverages Beautiful Soup, Splinter, and Pandas for data scraping, analysis, and visualization of Mars news and weather data.


## Project Overview

This project comprises two main components: the first part involves news scraping, while the second part focuses on collecting Mars weather data as a data frame and performing analysis on it.

### Part 1: Scraping Mars News: Unveiling the Mysteries

In this part, we'll gather the Mars news titles and summaries with Python, Splinter, and Beautiful Soup, saving them in a user-friendly  JSON file for easy access. 
The news data will be sourced from the website: [Mars News](https://website-name.com)


### Part 2: Unearthing Mars Weather Data: Gathering and Analyzing the Climate

We'll explore the Mars climate using Python, Splinter, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas visualizations. Highlights include:

- Scraping data from [Mars weather](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html)


- Precipitation: Plotting rainfall trends over the past 12 months.

*The most recent observed year's precipitation lacks discernible patterns.*

- Super Station: Identifying the most active weather station and its temperature extremes.
- Temperature Time Machine: Visualizing the temperature observations at the most active station over the last 12 months.

*The temperature predominantly hovers around 75 degrees throughout the year.*
